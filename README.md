# Background-Subtraction---GMM
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is popular method that has been employed to tackle the problem of background subtraction. However, the output of GMM is a rather noisy image which comes from false classification. This situation may arise because several conditions in the video input such as, waving trees, rippling water, and illumination changes. In this paper, an enhanced version of GMM technique which is combined with Hole Filling Algorithm (HF) is proposed to alleviate those problems. The experimental result shows that the proposed method improved the accuracy up to 97.9% and Kappa statistic up to 0.74. This result has outperformed many similar methods that is used for evaluation.
Foreground detection or moving object detection is a fundamental and critical task in video surveillance systems. Background subtraction using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a widely used approach for foreground detection. Many improvements have been proposed over the original GMM developed by Stauffer and Grimson (IEEE Computer Society conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, vol 2, Los Alamitos, pp 246â€“252, 1999. doi:10.1109/CVPR.1999.784637) to accommodate various challenges experienced in video surveillance systems.
